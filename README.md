# UsersLocationSpeed

Tip #460: User’s Location Speed. Get the speed of the users location using Core Location. Use the best accuracy for updating location and you don’t need to use the MapView to get location speed, it is only to visualize the changes to the speed as the location dot moves. Also in your info.plist you need to insert the Location Usage keys. It will give you a warning in the console when you run the app and it will tell you need it in order to access location.
